# Hidden Rules Among Classes

An interactive version of American education specialist Cynthia Payne’s grid of social traits. In her work, these are used to describe the traits of people in three social classes.

However, Payne’s work has been criticized for omitting to tackle the deeper reasons behind poverty, and for stereotyping supposed ”class traits”—see the [critique below](#critique), and the [references](#references) for more information.

This online version attempts to avoid unconscious bias by scrambling the three “class” columns, and also allowing you to choose freely from multiple items from the grid. It then presents a final score (from 100) for each “social class”, depending on your choices.

## Critique

> What I find most disturbing about the growing popularity of Payne’s work is that it may be a sign of the collective unwillingness of education leaders to challenge the system that empowers many of them, even if it does so at the expense of others. It may also be a sign that those of us committed to equity and justice in schools rely too heavily on the reputations and presentation skills of scholars and speakers while failing to examine critically the theories and frameworks upon which they build their work.
> 
> As child poverty in the U.S. continues to rise; as our government continues to cut programs for people in poverty; as conservative educational policy continues to gut public schools, particularly in poor areas, the need to understand the relationship between poverty and education grows increasingly urgent. An authentic framework for understanding this relationship must challenge us to think systemically. It must prepare us to be change agents, dedicated to rooting classism out of our classrooms, schools, and society, and not, as Payne’s work prepares us to do, to be maintainers of the status quo, at thousands and thousands of dollars per workshop.
